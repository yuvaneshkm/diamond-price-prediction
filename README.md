# ðŸ’Ž Diamond Price Prediction ðŸ’Ž
This project predicts diamond prices using machine learning models. The project workflow involves data ingestion, exploration, experimentation, and deployment using modular code organization, MLOps tools, and a Dockerized application.

# Project Overview

## Data Ingestion: 
The initial data was sourced from a MongoDB database. Data exploration and experimentation were conducted using Jupyter Notebook.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Detailed analysis to understand the data distribution, key patterns, and insights.

## Model Experimentation:
- **Models tested:** Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and ElasticNet.
- Lasso Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 93%.
- Various hyperparameters and cross-validation techniques were applied to optimize each model.

## Modular ML Code Organization:
- **Data Ingestion:** Handling and versioning input data.
- **Data Transformation:** Data cleaning and feature engineering.
- **Model Training:** Training and optimizing models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating and selecting the best model.
- Source code management was done using **Git**, and **DVC** was used for data versioning.
- **MLflow** was used for tracking parameters, metrics, and model registry. The final Lasso model is registered in the **MLflow Model Registry**.

## Pipelines:
- **Training Pipeline:** Automated workflow for data ingestion, transformation, and model training.
- **Prediction Pipeline:** Pipeline for model inference.

## User Interface (UI):
- A user-friendly web UI built with HTML and CSS.
- Developed a Flask app to serve the UI and prediction functionalities.

## Dockerized Deployment:
- The Flask app was Dockerized and pushed to Docker Hub.

## To pull and run the Docker image:
```bash
docker pull yuvaneshkm05/diamond-price-predictor
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 yuvaneshkm05/diamond-price-predictor
```
- After running, visit http://localhost:5000 to access the Diamond Price Predictor app.
